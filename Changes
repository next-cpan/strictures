  - more comprehensive testing

2.000001 - 2015-06-28
  - update for perl 5.22 warning categories
  - avoid using goto &UNIVERSAL::VERSION on perl 5.8, since it segfaults some
    builds

  - various test cleanups

2.000000 - 2015-02-26
  * Incompatible Changes
    - strictures 2 fatalizes only a subset of warnings.  Some warning
      categories are not safe to catch, or just inappropriate to have fatal.
      Existing code looking like 'use strictures 1;' will continue to get the
      old behavior of fatalizing all errors.  The new behavior will take effect
      when no version or version 2 is specified.

1.005006 - 2015-01-30
  - fix extra checks triggering on paths starting with t, xt, lib, or blib,
    rather than only triggering on those directories.
  - avoid stat checks for VCS directories until we are in an appropriately
    named file
  - various cleanups in test files

1.005005 - 2014-08-16

    test runs don't explode
